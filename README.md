# Compiler-Construction
Project course at DTU Course number 02247 Compiler Construction.

## Running the program
In order to run the j-- program make sure the j-- and ant are both correctly installed according to course instructions.

Open up the j-- folder in windows file explorer and in the path bar type cmd and press enter to open up a command window at that location.

build the ant aplication by using the command: ant jar

The command window should display build succesful message and the time it took to build the program.

Then use j-- commands to execute the different tests. (To see the possible j-- commands simply type j-- in the command window  and a list of possible commands should appear)

See the demonstration below as an example.
